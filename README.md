# SimpleStamina
A not so simple stamina system.

## To-Do List:
- Adding bow and crossbow stamina consumption.
- Adding armor stamina regen and regen delay effects.
- Polishing things like tool use for stamina. Probably don't just wanna use the default attack stamina cost. Maybe it will work, but I have to see first.
- Adding my own custom textures for the stamina bar.
- Adding the sectional support for the stamina bar.
- Adding a flashing effect when a stamina action is applied when the bar is empty. Will probably need to double check the network call to ensure 0 values are still sent.
- Allow the stamina bar to fade in and out, if set to contextual, instead just popping in and out as it does now.
- Making the stamina bar change colors dynamically depending on its fill level. Maybe levels higher than 100 could turn it blue/purple?
- Adding support for sleeping to set the stamina bar sections back to full.
- Adding support for certain foods giving a certain number of sections back per sleep cycle.
